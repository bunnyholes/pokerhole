# Phase 1 Archived Reports

**Archive Date**: 2025-10-03
**Reason**: Multiple conflicting status reports consolidated

> **⚠️ ARCHIVED**: These documents are historical only. For current status, see:
> - **VERIFIED_STATUS.md** (project root) - Fact-checked canonical status
> - **PHASE_1_HONEST_STATUS.md** (pokerhole-server/) - Most realistic assessment kept as active

## Archived Documents

These 5 reports all described Phase 1 completion but with conflicting data:

| Document | Test Count Claimed | Completion % | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|--------------|-------|
| PHASE_1_COMPLETED.md | 477 | 100% | Early report |
| PHASE_1_FINAL_REPORT.md | 477 | 100% | "Official" final report |
| PHASE_1_FINAL_SUMMARY.md | 483 | 95% actual | Acknowledged gaps |
| PHASE_1_ACTUAL_STATUS.md | 480 | 75% | More realistic |
| PHASE_1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md | (various) | (various) | Duplicate |

**Actual Test Count**: **502** (verified 2025-10-03 via grep)

## Why Multiple Reports Existed

During Phase 1 development, multiple status reports were created:
1. Initial completion report (PHASE_1_COMPLETED.md)
2. "Final" report attempting to be authoritative (PHASE_1_FINAL_REPORT.md)
3. Summary versions for different audiences (PHASE_1_FINAL_SUMMARY.md)
4. Honest reassessments as gaps discovered (PHASE_1_ACTUAL_STATUS.md, PHASE_1_HONEST_STATUS.md)

This led to documentation drift and conflicting information.

## Current Active Documents (Not Archived)

**Kept Active**:
- `PHASE_1_HONEST_STATUS.md` - Most realistic assessment, updated to 502 tests
- `/VERIFIED_STATUS.md` - New canonical source with verified facts only
- `/PROGRESS_SUMMARY.md` - Ongoing progress tracking, updated to 502 tests
- `/ROADMAP.md` - Project roadmap, updated to fix contradictions

## Lessons Learned

**Documentation Anti-Patterns Identified**:
1. ❌ Multiple "final" reports → led to conflicting "truth"
2. ❌ Copy-paste metrics → test counts diverged (471, 477, 480, 483)
3. ❌ No verification → claims didn't match actual code
4. ❌ No deprecation policy → old docs stayed "active"

**Best Practices Adopted**:
1. ✅ Single source of truth (VERIFIED_STATUS.md)
2. ✅ Verification commands documented (can re-run)
3. ✅ Clear archival process (this directory)
4. ✅ Disclaimers on uncertain docs

## Accessing Archived Reports

These files are preserved for historical reference:
- To understand what was believed at different points in time
- To trace how understanding evolved
- To avoid repeating the same documentation mistakes

**Do not use for current project status** - they contain outdated/incorrect information.
